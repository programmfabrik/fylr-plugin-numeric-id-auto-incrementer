# Numeric ID auto incrementer plugin

This server plugin for [fylr](https://docs.fylr.io) allows automatically setting the values of numeric ID fields when saving data. IDs are assigned in numerical order starting from 1 for each combination of values present in a defined set of base fields (see example below). Please note that the ID field as well as all base fields are expected to be grouped inside the same nested field.

## Installation

The latest version of this plugin can be found [here](https://github.com/programmfabrik/fylr-plugin-numeric-id-auto-incrementer/releases/latest/download/NumericIdAutoIncrementer.zip).

The ZIP can be downloaded and installed using the plugin manager, or used directly (recommended).

## Configuration

All plugin configuration takes place in base configuration.

* *Object types*:
    * *Object type name*: The name of the object type for which to set up ID generation
    * *Parent nested fields*:
        * *Path to parent field*: The path to the nested field that contains the ID field and the base fields.
        * *ID field name*: The name of the ID field to be filled out by the plugin. This has to be a numeric field. The field will only be updated if it is empty and if all base fields have been filled out by the user.
        * *Base field names*: The names of the base fields to consider when setting the ID. These can be text fields or fields of the [custom data type DANTE](https://github.com/programmfabrik/fylr-plugin-custom-data-type-dante).

## Example

### Configuration

* *Object type name*: example
* *Path to parent field*: _nested:example__parent
* *ID field name*: id
* *Base field names*: place, year

### Result

The field "id" contains the respective value as generated by the plugin.

Object 1:

    {
        "_nested:example__parent": [
            { "place": "London", "year": "2020", "id": 1 },
            { "place": "Berlin", "year": "2020", "id": 1 },
            { "place": "Berlin", "year": "2020", "id": 2 }
        ]
    }

Object 2:

    {
        "_nested:example__parent": [
            { "place": "London", "year": "2020", "id": 2 },
            { "place": "Berlin", "year": "2020", "id": 3 }
            { "place": "Berlin", "year": "2021", "id": 1 }
        ]
    }
